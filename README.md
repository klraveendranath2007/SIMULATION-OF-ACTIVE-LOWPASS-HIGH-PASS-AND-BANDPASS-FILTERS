# SIMULATION-OF-ACTIVE-LOWPASS-HIGH-PASS-AND-BANDPASS-FILTERS

## AIM : 
To Design and simulate the following circuits using LT-Spice  
a.	Active low pass filter  
b.	Active high pass filter  
c.	Active band pass filter  

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
•	Double click on LT-Spice icon.  
•	New schematic window open.  
•	Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .  
•	Complete the connection.  
•	Save the file by giving file name.  
•	Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.  
•	Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained.
